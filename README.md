-   ## Design

    -   ### Colour Scheme

        -   The four main colours used are Toon Bazaar black, white, pink and orange. These colours are supposed to imbue the site with a comic strip feel.

    -   ### Typography

        -   I use three Google fonts throughout the website to give it a cartoon feel:

        1) "Titan One", sans-serif;
         
         -   Titan One is used for the name brand and for direct marketing messaging.
        
        2) "Jomhuria", serif;

         -   Jomhuria is used for the contact form as it is easy to read but still has a comic touch about it.

        3) "Raleway", sans-serif;

         -    Raleway is used for the longer passages as it is easy to read and is widely considered a top ten font for web development. The main about section and the nav bar both use this font.
         
    -   ### Imagery

        -   Imagery is obviously very important, seeing as the website is supposed to showcase artwork of a high enough calibre to convince users to acquire our cartooning services.

        #### Background Images
        
        - The different background images on each page are of cartoon bazaars, in line with the name of our brand, Toon Bazaar. 
        
        - Each one was AI generated, using my own artwork as a start image or prompt. 
        
        - They are designed to be colourful, fun and striking, so as to catch the user's eye and incentivise them to take a look around and hopefully acquire our services. 
        
        - The homepage background image is supposed to showcase our ability to generate fantastic 3D content.

        - The market page background image is supposed to showcase our ability to generate fantastic 2D & comic strip content.

        - The contact page background image is supposed to showcase our ability to generate fantastic childish, playful and surreal content.

        #### **Homepage**:

        - Whilst the Homepage is there to explain to the user who we are at Toon Bazaar and what it is we do, it serves a secondary purpose of showcasing some of our 3D cartoons.

        #### 3D Comic Strip

        - Atop the page, sits an eye-catching 3D comic strip, describing why potential customers might desire or need our services.

        #### About Section

        - Beneath that, as the user scrolls down, they will come across an about section.

        - This section has various of our artists rendered as 3D cartoons, surrounding a sales pitch as to who we are, where we are, the services we can provide, the guarantee we offer, links to example artwork on the Marketplace page (market.html) and links to the contact form on the Contact page (contact.html).

        #### **Market Page**:

        - The Market Page is there to showcase daily artwork by our artists, so the user can get a feel for the work we produce.
        
        - The page is divided into 4 rows, with each one demonstrating a different medium we can provide:

        #### Animations

         - This section has a row of three 3D animations. 

        #### 2D Illustrations

        - This section has a row of three artboards showcasing 2D illustrations.
       
        
        #### Comics & Storyboards

        - This section has a row of three artboards showcasing:
        
        1. The first page of a storyboard

        2. The front cover of a graphic novel

        3. A comic strip

        #### Merchandise

        - This section features a bespoke colouring-in birthday card from parents to their spoilt son wrapped around an ai generated image showcasing the differents types of merchandise we can tailor-make for a client.

        #### **Contact Page**:

        - This features a lovely, colourful background image and a contact form.

        ## Structure

### Information Architecture

- The website has 3 pages:

    1. Homepage -  Landing page with a 3D comic strip, an about us section and links out to:

### Lighthouse Report for Contact Page (Mobile)
<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/lighthouse-mobile-contact.html.jpg"></h2>

I used the Lighthouse reports in Google Developer Tools to examine the pages of the website for the following
- Performace
- Accessibility
- Best Practices 
- SEO

All Pages performed well (scored 90 and above) for:
- Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO on Desktop
- Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO on Mobile

For Performance:
- The Home Page & Contact Page performed reasonably (scored between 74 and 88) on both Desktop and Mobile.
- The Market Page performed poorly (scored between 54 and 70) on both Desktop and Mobile.

Lighthouse recommends removing external fonts or placing them in the HTML rather than CSS code, saving images in next-gen formats, removing javascript iframes and eliminating render-blocking resources to improve performance on the Market Page. (Detailed in [Unresolved Bugs](#unresolved) section)

# Browser Compatibility

The site was tested in Brave, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox on desktop.

The site was tested in Google Chrome and Firefox on mobile and tablet.

No issues arose during browser testing. 

Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were largely consistent across browsers and devices, adapting fluidly when changing from portrait to landscape mode.

# Responsiveness

Responsivity tests were carried out using Google Chrome DevTools. Device screen sizes covered include:

- iPhone SE
- iPhone XR
- iPhone 12 Pro
- Pixel 5
- Samsung Galaxy S8+
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
- iPad Mini
- iPad Air
- Surface Pro 7
- Surface Duo
- Galaxy Fold
- Samsung Galaxy A51/71
- Nest Hub
- Nest Hub Max

I also created custom settings for FHD (1920x1080), 2k (2560x1440) & 4K (3840 x 2160) screens to ensure the web pages would work across monitor sizes.

        3. If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.
        1. At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
        2. To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
        3. There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Brave, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop & different S series Samsung phones.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly for both internal and external links.

### Unresolved

- Improve Lighthouse Performance score on all pages, but particularly the Market Page by making changes including:

    - Serve images in next-gen formats (Image formats like WebP and AVIF often provide better compression than PNG or JPEG, which means faster downloads and less data consumption.)
    - Eliminate render-blocking resources (Resources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles)
    - Minify CSS by using more inline HTML and defining styling in the head section


## Deployment
