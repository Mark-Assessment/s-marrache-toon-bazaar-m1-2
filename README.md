-   ## Design

    -   ### Colour Scheme

        -   The five main colours used for Toon Bazaar are black, white, pink, purple and orange. These colours are supposed to imbue the site with a vivid and colourful comic strip feel.

    -   ### Typography

        -   I use three Google fonts throughout the website to give it a cartoon feel:

        1) "Titan One", sans-serif;
         
         -   Titan One is used for the name brand and for direct marketing messaging.
        
        2) "Jomhuria", serif;

         -   Jomhuria is used for the contact form as it is easy to read but still has a comic touch about it.

        3) "Raleway", sans-serif;

         -    Raleway is used for the longer passages as it is easy to read and is widely considered a top ten font for web development. The main about section and the nav bar both use this font.
         
    -   ### Imagery

        -   Imagery is obviously very important, seeing as the website is supposed to showcase artwork of a high enough calibre to convince users to acquire our cartooning services.

        #### Background Images
        
        - The different background images on each page are of cartoon bazaars, in line with the name of our brand, Toon Bazaar. 
        
        - Each one was AI generated, using my own artwork as a start image or prompt. 
        
        - They are designed to be colourful, fun and striking, so as to catch the user's eye and incentivise them to take a look around and hopefully acquire our services. 
        
        - The homepage background image is supposed to showcase our ability to generate fantastic 3D content.

        - The market page background image is supposed to showcase our ability to generate fantastic 2D & comic strip content.

        - The contact page background image is supposed to showcase our ability to generate fantastic childish, playful and surreal content.

        #### **Homepage**:

        - Whilst the Homepage is there to explain to the user who we are at Toon Bazaar and what it is we do, it serves a secondary purpose of showcasing some of our 3D cartoons.

        #### 3D Comic Strip

        - Atop the page, sits an eye-catching 3D comic strip, describing why potential customers might desire or need our services.

        #### About Section

        - Beneath that, as the user scrolls down, they will come across an about section.

        - This section has various of our artists rendered as 3D cartoons, surrounding a sales pitch as to who we are, where we are, the services we can provide, the guarantee we offer, links to example artwork on the Marketplace page (market.html) and links to the contact form on the Contact page (contact.html).

        #### **Market Page**:

        - The Market Page is there to showcase daily artwork by our artists, so the user can get a feel for the work we produce.
        
        - The page is divided into 4 rows, with each one demonstrating a different medium we can provide:

        #### Animations

         - This section has a row of three 3D animations. 

        #### 2D Illustrations

        - This section has a row of three artboards showcasing 2D illustrations.
       
        
        #### Comics & Storyboards

        - This section has a row of three artboards showcasing:
        
        1. The first page of a storyboard

        2. The front cover of a graphic novel

        3. A comic strip

        #### Merchandise

        - This section features a bespoke colouring-in birthday card from parents to their spoilt son wrapped around an ai generated image showcasing the differents types of merchandise we can tailor-make for a client.

        #### **Contact Page**:

        - This features a lovely, colourful background image and a contact form.

    -   ### Icons
        
        - I used icons from Font Awesome for social media links in the footer and for the email subscription offer, to improve clarity and efficiency for my users.


-   ## Structure

    -   ### Information Architecture

        - The website has 3 pages:

        1. Homepage -  Landing page with a 3D comic strip, an about us section and links to:

        * External Artist Portfolios
        * Samples of 2D Toons
        * Samples of 3D Toons
        * Samples of Animations
        * Samples of Merchandise
        * A Contact Form with SignUp discount.


         2. Market Page - A Gallery Page, showcasing daily uploads of our artists' work. These are split into 4 rows, each showcasing three artboards or videos:

        * Animations
        * 2D Illustrations
        * Comics & Storyboards
        * Merchandise

        3. Contact Page - A Form Page, whereby clients can get in touch to make inquiries, requests and get a quote. Artists can also get in touch to inquire about becoming part of the collective.

    -   ### Irregular Structure

        -   The website includes a few structural irregularities:

        #### Embedded CSS 
        
        -   Background image styling placed in the head of the HTML file    instead of including it in the CSS stylesheet. Rationale:

            I wanted a background image which would stand out to potential users as a piece of quality artwork in its own right. However I didn't want it to detract from the artists' artwork in the foreground. 
        
            Therefore I opted for a fixed static background, whereby I could scroll through artwork in the foreground with nothing moving in the background. This proved to be the easiest way to do so, with the least impact on loading performance.

        #### Flexbox & Media Queries 

        -   My Media Queries use of Flexbox css is extensive because whenever I tried to create text boxes and make them flex with the images, I encountered two problems:

            -   [i] **Space vs Size** - I couldn't fit enough text inside a box the same size as one of the about section's border images. I tried using two boxes in column formation (each one sized according to the image next to it), but then formatting the text in the two boxes to look conjoined gave me problems. I tried flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis, but to no avail.

            -   [ii] **Duality vs Binary** - I needed the about section to flex with both the columns and the rows of images bordering it, but with flex I either had the option of choosing to flex the text with the row of images or the column of images, never both.
                Therefore I had to set different css rules for media queries spanning device sizes, from a tiny Galaxy Fold resolution size to a 4K monitor resolution size.

            If ever confronted with trying to build an image border around an article of text again, I will try and find an alternative and more efficient way of doing so.

- ### Future Improvements

If I want to improve my Best Practices score for the Market Page, I need to correct the aspect ratio for the images, as per:

https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/image-aspect-ratio/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools

I will weigh up the pros and cons at a future instance.

For Performance:

- The Home Page & Contact Page performed very well across the board, though for better SEO:

  - Text-size on the Homepage should be improved for Mobile.

- The Market Page performed not so well on Mobile and needs to be improved:

  - Lighthouse recommends the following:

  1. Removing external fonts or making them embedded.
  2. Saving images in next-gen formats. 
  3. Removing javascript iframes.
  4. Eliminating render-blocking resources to improve performance on the Market Page.

        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

        1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
        2. Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
        3. If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.
        1. At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
        2. To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
        3. There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Brave, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices, including a desktop, a laptop & a variety of different-sized S Series Samsung phones.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly for both internal and external links.

### Resolved Bugs



### Unresolved Bugs

-   Improve Lighthouse Performance score on all pages, but particularly the Market Page by making changes including:

    - Serve images in next-gen formats (Image formats like WebP and AVIF often provide better compression than PNG or JPEG, which means faster downloads and less data consumption.)
    - Eliminate render-blocking resources (Resources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles)
    - Minify CSS


## Deployment

### Code

-   [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/): I referred back to tutorial videos and my notes taken throughout the process of developing this website. The navbar and footer were built in an almost identical fashion and I referred to the code from the Coders Coffee House project to create the contact form page and to the code from the Love Running project to improve my use of Media Queries.

-   [Mozilla Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Media_queries): I also had to do a little more research via Mozilla Developer to achieve the exact level of responsiveness I wanted from Media Queries.

-   [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp): W3 Schools gave me the knowledge to create backgrounds featuring different gradients of colour.

-   [W3 Docs](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-create-an-anchor-link-to-jump-to-a-specific-part-of-a-page.html): W3 Docs gave me the knowledge to link to a specific section of the same page or another page.

-   [Google's IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference): It was through Google's own page that I learnt how to insert and resize their IFrame Player API.

-   [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-revert-commit-how-to-undo-the-last-commit/): Free Code Camp gave me the knowledge to reset or revert the changes of a recent git commit.

-   [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp): W3 Schools gave me the knowledge to create backgrounds featuring different gradients of colour.

-   [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12991351/how-to-force-image-resize-and-keep-aspect-ratio): Stack Overflow gave me the knowledge to force an image to resize but retain the aspect ratio?

-   [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/text-underline-position/): CSS-TRICKS gave me the knowledge to set the placement of the underline so it wasn't broken by the text when using the Jomhuria font.
