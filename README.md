## Toon Bazaar

<h3 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/techsini-homepage.png"></h3>

Toon Bazaar is a site offering bespoke cartoon, comic, illustration and animation services.

The collective of cartoonists are happy to create anything for a respective customer, from simple greeting cards and t-shirts to graphic novels or full feature animations.

This is the main marketing website for Toon Bazaar. 

It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential clients wishing to see the services on offer and initiate contact. Freelance artists hoping to join should also find the website useful in understanding the community, assessing whether it is somewhere they would like to work and, if so, starting the application process.

-   # Design

-   ## Colour Scheme

    -   The five main colours used for Toon Bazaar are black, orange, white, pink and purple. These colours are supposed to imbue the site with a vivid and colourful comic strip feel.
  
  <h3 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/palette-toon-bazaar.png"></h3>
  
  
-   ## Typography

    -   I use three Google fonts throughout the website to give it a cartoon feel:

    1) "Titan One", sans-serif;
         
         -   Titan One is used for the name brand and for direct marketing messaging.
        
        <h3 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/titan-one.jpg"></h3>

    2)  "Jomhuria", serif;

         -   Jomhuria is used for the contact form as it is easy to read but still has a comic touch about it.
        
        <h3 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/jomhuria.jpg"></h3>

    3) "Raleway", sans-serif;

         -    Raleway is used for the longer passages as it is easy to read and is widely considered a top ten font for web development. The main about section and the nav bar both use this font.

        <h3 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/raleway.jpg"></h3>
         
    -   ## Imagery

        -   Imagery is obviously very important, seeing as the website is supposed to showcase artwork of a high enough calibre to convince users to acquire our cartooning services.

        ### Background Images
        
        - The different background images on each page are of cartoon bazaars, in line with the name of our brand, Toon Bazaar. 
        
        - Each one was AI generated, using my own artwork as a start image or prompt. 
        
        - They are designed to be colourful, fun and striking, so as to catch the user's eye and incentivise them to take a look around and hopefully acquire our services. 
        
        - The homepage background image is supposed to showcase our ability to generate fantastic 3D content.

        - The market page background image is supposed to showcase our ability to generate fantastic 2D & comic strip content.

        - The contact page background image is supposed to showcase our ability to generate fantastic childish, playful and surreal content.

        ### **Homepage**:

        - Whilst the Homepage is there to explain to the user who we are at Toon Bazaar and what it is we do; it serves a secondary purpose of showcasing some of our 3D cartoons.

        ### 3D Comic Strip

        - Atop the page, sits an eye-catching 3D comic strip, describing why potential customers might desire or need our services.

        ### About Section

        - Beneath that, as the user scrolls down, they will come across an about section.

        - This section has various of our artists rendered as 3D cartoons, surrounding a sales pitch as to who we are, where we are, the services we can provide, the guarantee we offer, links to example artwork on the Marketplace page (market.html) and links to the contact form on the Contact page (contact.html).

        ### **Market Page**:

        - The Market Page is there to showcase daily artwork by our artists, so the user can get a feel for the work we produce.
        
        - The page is divided into 4 rows, with each one demonstrating a different medium we can provide:

        ### 1. Animations

         - This section has a row of three 3D animations. 

        ### 2. 2D Illustrations

        - This section has a row of three artboards showcasing 2D illustrations.
       
        
        ### 3. Comics & Storyboards

        - This section has a row of three artboards showcasing:
        
        1. The first page of a storyboard

        2. The front cover of a graphic novel

        3. A comic strip

        ### 4. Merchandise

        - This section features a bespoke colouring-in birthday card from parents to their spoilt son wrapped around an AI generated image showcasing the different types of merchandise we can tailor-make for a client.

        ### **Contact Page**:

        - This features a lovely, colourful, surreal background image and a contact form.

    -   ## Icons
        
        - I used icons from Font Awesome for social media links in the footer and for the email subscription offer, to improve clarity and efficiency for my users.


-   # Structure

    -   ## Information Architecture

        - The website has 3 pages:

        1. *Homepage* -  Landing page with a 3D comic strip, an about us section and links to:

        * External Artist Portfolios
        * Samples of 2D Toons
        * Samples of 3D Toons
        * Samples of Animations
        * Samples of Merchandise
        * A Contact Form with a SignUp discount.


         2. *Market Page* - A Gallery Page, showcasing daily uploads of our artists' work. These are split into 4 rows, each showcasing three artboards or videos:

        * Animations
        * 2D Illustrations
        * Comics & Storyboards
        * Merchandise

        3. *Contact Page* - A Form Page, whereby clients can get in touch to make inquiries, requests and get a quote. At the bottom of the page, users are given the option to subscribe to our newsletter for a 15% discount.  Artists can also get in touch to inquire about becoming part of the collective.

    -   ## Irregular Structure

        -   The website includes a few structural irregularities:

        ### Embedded CSS 
        
        -   Background image styling placed in the head of the HTML file    instead of including it in the CSS stylesheet. Rationale:

            I wanted a background image which would stand out to potential users as a piece of quality artwork in its own right. However, I didn't want it to detract from the artists' artwork in the foreground. 
        
            Therefore, I opted for a fixed static background, whereby I could scroll through artwork in the foreground with nothing moving in the background. This proved to be the easiest way to do so, with the least impact on loading performance.

        ### Flexbox & Media Queries 

        -   My Media Queries use of Flexbox css is extensive because whenever I tried to create text boxes and make them flex with the images, I encountered two problems:

            -   [i] **Space vs Size** - I couldn't fit enough text inside a box the same size as one of the about section's border images. I tried using two boxes in column-formation (each one sized according to the image next to it), but then formatting the text in the two boxes to look conjoined gave me problems. I tried flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis, but to no avail.

            -   [ii] **Duality vs Binary** - I needed the about section to flex with both the columns and the rows of images bordering it, but with flex I either had the option of choosing to flex the text with the row of images or the column of images, never both.
            Therefore, I had to set different css rules for Media Queries spanning all the device sizes, from a tiny Galaxy Fold resolution to a 4K monitor resolution.

            If ever confronted with trying to build an image border around an article of text again, I will obviously use an alternative and more efficient way to do so.

        - When a user clicks on a piece of artwork (be it an image or a video) a new frame will pop up in the foreground, allowing the user to view the art in a larger frame with greater detail. Then they will be able to scroll horizontally through the different pieces of art. More details here: 
        [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5zTYYOX1to] | 
        [https://codinginpublic.dev/projects/popup-image-slider/]


    -   ### Onsite Artist Portfolios

        - Ideally in a future update, all the artist portfolios will be onsite and available via internal links.

    -   ### Academy Page

        - I would like to add a page with tutorials (text & video) and the ability to be tutored online by the user's artist of choice.

    -   ### 404 Page
        - I will add a colourful and friendly custom 404 error page to help the user navigate back to the Homepage if they enter an incorrect URL. I will achieve this by following this Github documentation:
         [Github Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site).

- ## Future Improvements

- ### Desktop

    - ### Market Page
  
      - **Best Practices**

      - If I want to improve my *Best Practices* score for the Market Page, I need to correct the aspect ratio for the images, as per:

      - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/image-aspect-ratio/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools

      - I will weigh up the pros and cons at a future instance.

      - Otherwise, I am satisfied with all of my Desktop results.

- ### Mobile
  
    - ### Homepage
  
      - **SEO**
  
      - The Homepage *SEO* score could be improved by:

      - Increasing text-size on the Homepage for mobile devices.
   
    - ### Market Page

       1. **Best Practices**
    
      - If I want to improve my *Best Practices* score for the Market Page, I need to correct the aspect ratio for the images, as per:

      - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/image-aspect-ratio/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools

      - I will weigh up the pros and cons at a future instance.

      2. **Performance**

      - The Market Page loads slowly on Mobile and the *Performance* needs to be improved:

      - Lighthouse recommends the following:

      1. Removing external fonts or embedding them in the HTML
      2. Saving images in next-gen formats
      3. Removing javascript iframes
      4. Eliminating render-blocking resources to improve Performance

1. *As a Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site, learn more about the collective and get a feeling for who they are, where they are, what they have to offer and how they intend to deliver.*

    + Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a 3D comic strip explaining in four frames why they might need or want our help. That's the 'WHY?' sorted.
  
    + Once they have read the comic strip, they arrive at the about section, where we spell out where we are located (everywhere) and how we can help them. There are also links to the contact form wherein they can make requests or get a quote. That's the ''WHO?', 'WHERE?' & 'HOW?' sorted.
  
    + The user can then navigate via the links in the about section to examples of our artwork adorning the Homepage & Market Page. That's the 'WHAT?' sorted.

2. *As a Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.*
